Key overscribed

Do you know ehat happens when we declare an object and then we added to him a property in an
numeric index and then we add a new thing to this object by using the same key but as a string?
Let's chack it out:

const o = {};
o["1"] = 'hi';
o[1] = 'hello';

console.log(o['1'])

This will print the 'hello' string because all the keys are stringified before being added to the
object.
