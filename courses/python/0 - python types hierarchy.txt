Python is not a very long language, in fact, we have some small set of words that describe the
language in a very complete way. One very important stuff to be inside the python knowledge is to
pay attentions on the python main types.

Basically we have the follow amount of types:

* Numbers
  - integral: integers and booleans
  - Non-integral: floats, complex, decimals, fractions.

* Collections
  - Mutable: lists, sets
  - Immutable: tuples, strings, frozen sets
  - Mappings: dictionaries

* Callables
  - User-defined functions
  - Generators
  - Classes
  - Instance methods
  - Class instances (__call__())
  - Built-in functions (e.g. len(), open())
  - Builtin-methods (e.g. mylist.append(x))

* Singletons
  - None
  - NotImplemented
  - Ellipsis (...)
