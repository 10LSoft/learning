One thing that we can use to make really good tests in react world is testing-library! This is a
very usefull lib to make react tests run with plenty full of potential. This is the documentation
for this lib:

https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/

Here we can found things like debuger, which is a function that render in screen the component
content and is util for do some internal component structure tests with a visual approach of a
rendered component. Something like the inspector of browser.
